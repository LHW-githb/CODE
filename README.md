Missile Control via Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL)

This repository contains code for training reinforcement learning models using Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), specifically in the context of missile control simulation.

The objective is to train a policy model that can control a missile’s flight dynamics based on expert demonstrations. This is done by using GAIL, which combines imitation learning and adversarial training to match the policy to the expert’s behavior.
