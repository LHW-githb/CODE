Missile guidance via Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) and Continuous Learning

This repository contains code for training reinforcement learning models using Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), specifically in the context of missile guidance simulation.
The objective is to train a policy model that can control a missile’s flight dynamics based on expert demonstrations. This is done by using GAIL, which combines imitation learning and adversarial training to match the policy to the expert’s behavior.
